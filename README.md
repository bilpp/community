# Bilpp Community

Welcome to the Bilpp community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Bilpp community - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.

To learn more about the project structure and organization, please refer to [Project Governance] information.

## Communicating

The [communication](communication/) page lists communication channels like chat,
issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

For more specific topics, try a SIG.

## Governance

Bilpp has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

* **Committees** are named sets of people that are chartered to take on sensitive topics.
  This group is encouraged to be as open as possible while achieving its mission but, because of the nature of the topics discussed, private communications are allowed.
  Examples of committees include the steering committee and things like security or code of conduct.
* **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project.
  SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings.
  Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute provided they follow the Bilpp Code of Conduct.
  The purpose of a SIG is to own and develop a set of **subprojects**.
  * **Subprojects** Each SIG can have a set of subprojects.
    These are smaller groups that can work independently.
    Some subprojects will be part of the main Bilpp deliverables while others will be more speculative and live in the `bilpp-sigs` github org.
* **Working Groups** are temporary groups that are formed to address issues that cross SIG boundaries.
  Working groups do not own any code or other long term artifacts.
  Working groups can report back and act through involved SIGs.
* **User Groups** are groups for facilitating communication and discovery of information related to
  topics that have long term relevance to large groups of Bilpp users.
  They do not have ownership of parts of the Bilpp code base.

See the [full governance doc](governance.md) for more details on these groups.
